I'm currently working on an OpenFL project with the goal of using an open source slicer to create FLP files for the Formlabs Form1/1+ 3D printers. Progress is being uploaded to [The Open Source Manufacturing OpenFL Fork](https://github.com/opensourcemanufacturing/OpenFL), check out the Dev branch for some of the scripts I'm currently working on.
